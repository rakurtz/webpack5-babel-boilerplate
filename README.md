# webpack5-babel-boilerplate

I was watching modern-javascript course by Shain (netninja). Since a lot has changed since the recording date of the course i ran into some problems with the boilerplate code provided by Shaun.

So feel free to use the updated boilerplate code for recent versions of webpack and babel (as of Octobre 2022).
